How do I approach designing software?

What new design skills have your work on the project helped you to craft? For example, I learned how to work with the OpenGL API and dabbled a little bit with the Vulcan API. 

What design process did you follow for your project work? I followed a linear process. I thought the tutorials took my time reading through documentation and YouTube videos.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? For example, I would follow documentation. But, first, it’s the ins and outs of the language or API.

How do I approach developing programs?

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? When I used the villain strategy because using open GL was very new to me and was quite daunting, I got frustrated at times. I know that it is easier to walk away from my computer sometimes, clear my head, and retake the situation to assess a problem better and come up with a viable solution.

How did iteration factor into your development? What is meant by integration is the version of the libraries or languages self throughout this class. Modern OpenGL is being used. I think version 4, but it didn’t play a huge factor. I didn’t have any problems.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones which led you to the project’s completion? 

This course gives me a new approach to developing code and how I should approach it. I should approach my development process, and any future projects with a more methodical and planned-out approach iPhone are it I work better when I’ve laid everything out in front of me and all the taxes implemented at that point. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? 
For example, competitional graphics and visualization have taught me software development practices I can take to my future education endeavors and professional work as a developer. In addition, I think it is giving me the tools to assess my code in a way that allows me to be effective.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? 

Professionally Computational graphics and  Visualization give me the knowledge and skills to be able to effectively use different APIs as well as other languages and understand the nuances and quirks that come along with with the various applications or programs that I might develop professionally.
